# DMC Floss API
A work in progress API for changing DMC brand embroidery floss from its associated product number to both its hex code and RGB value. An example of its use would be converting a picture to an embroidery pattern, where you wouldn't have to guess at the closest color thread.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Express.JS

I've used a DMC floss to hex code list, a hex code to RGB converter, and a lot of time and patience.

## Optimizations
- Needs a proper landing page.
- Needs some CSS to make things look more put together on said landing page.
- Needs some formatting to keep everything uniform and clean.
- Needs an explanation on why you won't find mixed color embroidery threads on the list.

## Lessons Learned:

An API with this many items takes a lot of time.

Between finding the information, coding, formatting, and getting back into the groove when picking up where I left off, this project has taken me over 20 hours so far. It's easy to break things when you've got over 2000 lines of code, and most of it looks very similar. It's an exercise in patience to keep at doing the same thing over, and over, and over for that long.
